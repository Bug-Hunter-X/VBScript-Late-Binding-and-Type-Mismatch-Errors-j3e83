This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: runtime errors due to late binding and type mismatches.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with improved type handling.  The issue is particularly prevalent when interacting with COM objects or external libraries where object existence or type isn't guaranteed at compile time.
